# Aldrnari Gamepad Setup & Guide

![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/qOPBy7D.png)

Setting up Aldrnari with a gamepad can be a daunting task with all of it's extra features and possible keybinds. In addition to that, the main combat mod, Engarde, works in such a way that dodges and power attacks won't respond to your analog stick movements - effectively locking you out of most of your defensive and offensive options right off the bat. There are some workarounds such as mapping your controller to keyboard keys for movement, but this is less than ideal. With this guide, you'll be able to play Aldrnari utilizing all of what it's systems have to offer with your gamepad (mostly comfortably) while still enjoying all of what a controller brings to the table. Finally, you won't have to download any crazy software or tinker around with configurations - all of that has been done for you and is easily available within Steam's controller configuration tool.

... You *will* have to spend time and read this guide in its entirety though, otherwise you will be lost when trying to use your controller in game. You will also be told to RTFM if you ask any questions about controller support in the Aldrnari support channel that are answered within this guide. 

## First Steps & Setup
### Additional Mod Activation

The first step is opening up MO2 and looking within the main pane (on the left) to ensure that the mod "Extended Hotkey System" is enabled under the "User Interface" seperator. This mod allows any key to be used as a hotkey within SKYUI's favorites menu and is integral for full utilization of your gamepad. Once you've checked the box next to the "Extended Hotkey System" mod, you can open Steam for the next step.

### Steam Controller Configuration Setup

Once you have Steam open, ensure that your controller is on and being read by Steam. From here, go over to Skyrim Special Edition in your library and click on "Controller Configuration" right underneath the logo on the right side. Now click on the "Browse Configs" button. This will bring up several options. We want to mouse over to "Community" bindings. Now, depending on the controller you're using, you may have to click the button at the bottom of the screen "Show Other Controller Types" in order to see the configurations. 

The configurations were made on a PS5 controller and an Xbox Elite controller but they will still work with earlier generation models. That is to say, the PS5 controller configuration works with a PS4 controller and the Xbox Elite configuration works with any Xbox controller. If you're using some sort of wonky 3rd party controller, it *should* work with the Xbox configuration. My configurations are most likely down at the bottom of the list and are titled "Aldrnari Controller Configuration (Controller Type) V1.0." You should use the newest Xbox configuration, V1.1 as I forgot the standing power attack keybind in the V1.0. Apply the appropriate configuration and you can move on to the next steps.

## Configuration Explanation

These configurations were made possible by Steam's "shift modifier" and "action layer" options. What that means is this - While playing normally, you have the vanilla keybinds (for the most part). However, when you hold one or two of the modifiers, you get another set of new keybinds. I made both configurations virtually the same between PS4/5 and Xbox for ease of use. The two modifiers I make extensive use of are the LB and RB buttons on the Xbox controller and L1, R1 & Right Side Pad (RSP) on the PS4/5 controller. That means their vanilla functions have been remapped elswhere on the controller where it makes sense in order to free them up for modifier usage. These will be your main mode of switching your "focus".

With how many keybinds are necessary to fully utilize ultra-modded Skyrim, any gamepad setup can get quite complicated. With that being said, I have attempted to make this less daunting by having each modifier have a specific "focus." Here are the areas of "focus" that I built into the configurations:

- Directional Pad Buttons (Hotkey Focus): Holding LB/L1 will give you access to your first 4 group hotkeys (from SkyUI, more on that later) and are located on the directional pad. Holding LB/L1 and then RB/R1 will give you access to the remaining 4 groups, also on your directional pad. 
- Directional Pad Buttons (Follower Focus): Holding RB/RSP gives you access to several of the follower commands from Follower Framework, mapped to the directional buttons. Holding RB/RSP and then LB/L1 gives you access to the remaining 4 follower commands, also on the directional pad.


- Face Buttons (Combat Actions Focus): Holding LB/L1 will give you access to all four directional dodges available from Engarde (Read the [Modified Gameplay.md](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari/blob/main/Modified%20Gameplay.md) for more information about it) which are located on the face buttons in the directions that make sense - the left button (Square for PS4/5 or X for Xbox) makes you dodge left, and the right button (Circle for PS4/5 or B for Xbox) makes you dodge right etc. Holding LB/L1 and then RB/R1 will give you access to your power attacks from Engarde. These were also implemented in the same way as the dodges - Square/X gives you the left power attack and Circle/B gives you the right power attack. The one exception to this is the standing power attack. This was mapped to holding L1 and then pressing the right trigger for PS4/5 and holding RB and pressing the right trigger for Xbox as there was no more room on the face button pad. 
- Face Buttons (Campfire Actions): Holding RB/RSP will give you all four Campfire actions on your face buttons (Square/X = Create Item, Triangle/Y = Build Campfire, Circle/B = Harvest Wood, and X/A = Instincts.)



## Keybindings

This section will list out the keybinding setup for both controller configurations. The way these configurations work is with modifier buttons which allow us all the extra buttons we need. I use the vanilla control scheme for both the keyboard (with one exception) and the controller so you don't need to adjust anything. You will, however, need to memorize these keybinds. My aim was to make them make sense and be user friendly, but that does not mean they can't be improved. For those of you that want to edit things - feel free to do so but know that you void any support in the Aldrnari support channel if you do. 

### PS4/PS5:

I highly suggest you take a look at the configurations and familiarize yourself with the buttons. All have been labeled so you can easily see what button does what. They will also be listed for a comprehensive view of every keybind, but they will make more sense if you visualize them in the configuration. Make sure to switch between all three layers (Default, L1 Hotkeys and Right Pad Hotkeys).

## MCM & Control Settings

You're nearly there! We just need to change one vanilla keyboard control and setup the MCMs for our hotkeys to work correctly. 

### Vanilla Control Changes

You have but one key to change here, and that is to remap the command Run from "shift" to "Numpad."

### MCM Settings

It is imperative that you map all keys exactly as they are in this guide! The configurations were built around these specific keybinds, so if you change any of them, you'll have to change the Steam Controller Configurations as well. 

#### Campfire
- Gameplay
  - Hotkeys
    - Create Item - N
    - Build Campfire - B
    - Harvest Wood - H
    - Instincts - G

#### Engarde

  - Power Attack Key - ]
  - Defensive Action Key - \

#### Follower Framework
- Activity
  - Catch Up (Teleport) 
    - Teleport Followers Hotkey - Numpad 7
  - Waiting
    - Followers Wait/Follow Key - Numpad 5

  - Follower Action Keybinds
    - Command Followers - Numpad 1
    - Followers Attack - Numpad 4
    - Followers Retreat - Numpad 2
    - Calm Followers - Numpad 3
    - Followers Behind You - Numpad 6
    - Trade Items - Numpad 8

#### Optimal Potion Hotkey
  - Hotkeys
    - Health Potion Hotkey - , (That is this key (<) for those unsure)
    - Magicka Potion Hotkey - . (That is this key (>) for those unsure)
    - I did not add in the stamina potion hotkey because I never use it and there is limited real-estate to work with as it is... If you want it you'll have to add it in yourself.

#### SkyUI
  - Controls
    - Favorite Groups
      - Group 1 - F1
      - Group 2 - F2
      - Group 3 - F3
      - Group 4 - F4
      - Group 5 - F6
      - Group 6 - F7
      - Group 7 - F8
      - Group 8 - F10
      - Be careful not to map F5 or F9 here, we want to keep those free as they are quick-save and quick-load. 

#### SmoothCam
  - Following
    - Misc
      - Shoulder Swap Key - V

#### True Directional Movement
  - Target Lock
    - Controls
      - Toggle Target Lock Key - Numpad /
      - Ensure that you do NOT have "Toggle Target Lock with Toggle POV Button" selected. 
      - I also personally go into the Target Lock Widget and make the lock on UI a simple dot and scale it down. That is, of course, up to you. 

### Remaining Free Keybinds

There are still quite a few keys on your keyboard left for possible hotkey use. You have the entire numbers line (not the numpad, most of those are being used) as well as the following keys: O, U, Y, K, and L. That should be more than enough. Unfortunately, if you want to use any hotkeys beyond what I've built into the configurations, you'll have to add them in yourself. Support for this endeavor will not be provided. Fortunately, it isn't very hard to figure out with a little time and effort.

## Final Tips

While this setup has worked well in my testing, there are a few quirks that can and will occur. During my testing they did not hamper or stop my gameplay. I will attempt to address them all as I have encountered them.

#### Dodging Quirks

If you never use lock on from True Directional Movement, you will never be able to use the directional dodging feature. When you press any of the dodge directions, you will simply dodge/slide/roll in the direction you are moving. This can be useful if you switch back and forth between locking on and not locking on. It is not a bug though, so don't ask in support as if it is. Also, I have found it unreliable to roll dodge by mashing the dodge key as you would in keyboard and mouse mode. As such, I do not rely on it. Feel free to explore it's usage more though. Perhaps you will have a different experience than me. 

#### Power Attack Quirks 

Power attacks work and function in much the same way as the dodge does - when not locked on, you will only ever get the forward power attack or the standing power attack depending on if you use the directional power attack hotkeys or the standing power attack hotkey (Duh). Also, I have found that, rarely, my character will get "stuck" doing the same power attack despite pressing different power attack hotkeys. This can be fixed by sprinting and/or using a standing power attack. It *seems* to me that this is a vanilla Skyrim foible, as such, please do not ask about it in support. 

#### SkyUI Favorites & Groups

If you're like me, you've never used the hotkeys provided by SkyUI. Well, if you want to really have fun, you need to change that up. I learned about them for the first time myself while I built these configurations. I have found them to be an amazing replacement for the somewhat script heavy Serio's Hotkeys that I use to use in every list. If you are unsure how the groups work, watch this [SkyUI Favorites & Groups Tutorial](https://youtu.be/FSrwmH4_dJM). Now that you understand how they work, you can fully utilize the 8 groups you have available from these configurations. You never have to pause during combat again, it really is amazing. 

Some tips I have for utilizing those groups on your 8 directional pad hotkeys. I tend to keep a theme on specific directional pad buttons. For example, the down directional pad button is easy to get to when you're in combat, so I tend to map healing spells there on the first layer (thats group 2 while just holding L1/LB) and then I use the second layer as buffs which is group 6 (while holding L1/LB + R1/RB). Then I keep offensive magic on the two left directional pad hotkeys I have and utility spells for the up directional pad hotkeys. That leaves me with two slots on my right directional pad keys for two different groups of whatever I want (perhaps swords, bows etc...). Additionally, you have two quick access hotkeys when not holding down ANY modifiers (as in, just playing normally) - the left direction key and right direction key. I use these for two quick access shouts or powers so I can... well, switch between them quickly. 

If you take the time to understand how these systems and features work, you will reap the benefit when you actually get around to playing the game.

#### Extended Hotkey System

While this mod provides a great amount of freedom, I am, in truth, not utilizing much of it in this guide. However, if you feel you need more hotkeys than I have provided, feel free to add as many as you want and add as many layers to your steam configuration as you would like. I feel 8 groups plus 2 quick access hotkeys is more than enough for most, including me. As I've stated before though, if you venture off beyond the scope of this guide, please do not ask for support in the support channel. Sovn has enough to manage as it is. 

#### You're Done! Have Fun!
