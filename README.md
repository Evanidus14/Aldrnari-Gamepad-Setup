# Aldrnari Gamepad Setup & Guide

![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/qOPBy7D.png)

Setting up Aldrnari with a gamepad can be a daunting task with all of it's extra features and possible keybinds. In addition to that, the main combat mod, Engarde, works in such a way that dodges and power attacks won't respond to your analog stick movements - effectively locking you out of most of your defensive and offensive options right off the bat. There are some workarounds such as mapping your controller to keyboard keys for movement, but this is less than ideal. With this guide, you'll be able to play Aldrnari utilizing all of what it's systems have to offer with your gamepad (mostly comfortably) while still enjoying all of what a controller brings to the table. Finally, you won't have to download any crazy software or tinker around with configurations - all of that has been done for you and is easily available within Steam's controller configuration tool. 

## First Steps & Setup
### Additional Mod Activation

The first step is opening up MO2 and looking within the main pane (on the left) to ensure that the mod "Extended Hotkey System" is enabled under the "User Interface" seperator. This mod allows any key to be used as a hotkey within SKYUI's favorites menu and is integral for full utilization of your gamepad. Once you've checked the box next to the "Extended Hotkey System" mod, you can open Steam for the next step.

### Steam Controller Configuration Setup

Once you have Steam open, ensure that your controller is on and being read by Steam. From here, go over to Skyrim Special Edition in your library and click on "Controller Configuration" right underneath the logo on the right side. Now click on the "Browse Configs" button. This will bring up several options. We want to mouse over to "Community" bindings. Now, depending on the controller you're using, you may have to click the button at the bottom of the screen "Show Other Controller Types" in order to see the configurations. The configurations were made on a PS5 controller and an Xbox Elite controller but they will still work with earlier generation models. That is to say, the PS5 controller configuration works with a PS4 controller and the Xbox Elite configuration works with any Xbox controller. If you're using some sort of wonky 3rd party controller, it *should* work with the Xbox configuration. My configurations are most likely down at the bottom of the list and are titled "Aldrnari Controller Configuration." Apply the appropriate configuration and you can move on to the next steps.

### Keybindings

This section will list out the keybinding setup for both controller configurations. The way these configurations work is with modifier buttons which allow us all the extra buttons we need. I use the vanilla control scheme for both the keyboard (with one exception) and the controller so you don't need to adjust anything. You will, however, need to memorize these keybinds. My aim was to make them make sense and be user friendly, but that does not mean they can't be improved. For those of you that want to edit things - feel free to do so but know that you void any support in the Aldrnari support channel if you do.
