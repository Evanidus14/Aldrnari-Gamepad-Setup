# Aldrnari Gamepad Setup & Guide

![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/qOPBy7D.png)

Setting up Aldrnari with a gamepad can be a daunting task with all of it's extra features and possible keybinds. In addition to that, the main combat mod, Engarde, works in such a way that dodges and power attacks won't respond to your analog stick movements - effectively locking you out of most of your defensive and offensive options right off the bat. There are some workarounds such as mapping your controller to keyboard keys for movement, but this is less than ideal. With this guide, you'll be able to play Aldrnari utilizing all of what it's systems have to offer with your gamepad (mostly comfortably) while still enjoying all of what a controller brings to the table. Finally, you won't have to download any crazy software or tinker around with configurations - all of that has been done for you and is easily available within Steam's controller configuration tool. 

## First Steps & Setup

The first step is opening up MO2 and looking within the main pane (on the left) to ensure that the mod "Extended Hotkey System" is enabled under the "User Interface" seperator. This mod allows any key to be used as a hotkey within SKYUI's favorites menu and is integral for full utilization of your gamepad. Once you've checked the box next to the "Extended Hotkey System" mod, you can open Steam for the next step.

Once you have Steam open, ensure that your controller is on and being read by Steam. From here, go over to Skyrim Special Edition in your library and click on "Controller Configuration" right underneath the logo on the right side. Now click on the "Browse Configs" button. This will bring up several options. We want to mouse over to "Community" bindings. Now, depending on the controller you're using, you may have to click the button at the bottom of the screen "Show Other Controller Types" in order to see the configurations. The configurations were made on a PS5 controller and an Xbox Elite controller but they will still work with earlier generation models. That is to say, the PS5 controller configuration works with a PS4 controller and the Xbox Elite configuration works with any Xbox controller. If you're using some sort of wonky 3rd party controller, it *should* work with the Xbox configuration. My configurations are most likely down at the bottom of the list and are titled "Aldrnari Controller Configuration." Apply the appropriate configuration and you can move on to the next steps.

## What the list is
### Beta Goals

Beta of Aldrnari is here to test most of the gameplay and quests and to see if it's playable and fun while also bug-hunting. A lot of stuff is planned, so sit tight if your favourite quest mod, player home, or armor isn't in. It may change in the future.
Please do not ask for exact names of what is planned. Just be patient and excited for the future. It will be a long development process.

## Gameplay - Combat | Engarde

The main combat overhaul of Aldrnari is **[Engarde](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25673) - "Fixing Skyrim's melee combat one tweak at a time"**.

It is one of the most diverse combat overhauls on Nexus and a really fun one when mastered. Here I will describe a few core mechanics, but since it has so many mechanics, I highly suggest reading and watching videos on it (or don't and figure out techniques and mechanics by yourself, at the price of a lot of deaths).

Unique Mechanics:
- Stamina Management: It is more similar to the Dark Souls Style; two or three slashes will deplete your full stamina and you wont be able to attack anymore, you will need to back off (and use the walk button) to regenerate a part of it. Power Attacks and blocking also depletes it. 
- Power Attacks: It is bound to a third button, detached from your usual click, and it has a cooldown. No more power attack spam with a warhammer to kill every bandit.
- Off-hand: By default, if you have a Sword and a spell on your off-hand, using your left hand key will block and not use the spell. This allows dual wield blocking (which is needed in Aldrnari). To use the spell in your off-hand, press shift (by default) and your left hand key at the same time.
- Enemies actually use stamina, so if they spam power attacks, play defensively and wait for the moment to strike!
- Weapons have different ranges depending on what type they are.
- Armors have resistances based on their keywords. If you use a dagger against steel armor, it obviously won't penetrate the steel. The same system applies to you, though, so play smart!
- [Dodging is extremely important](http://prntscr.com/1i3k35m), the default key is C (when following my MCM Setup) and will only work when weapons are drawn. The invincibility frames, also known as iFrames, are generous, and it'll get you out of trouble a lot.

### Gameplay - Combat | Other Combat Overhauls

The list doesn't only ship with Engarde! Other mods come to make an ever more Dark Souls-inspired combat experience;
- [ZUPA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45182) forces 3rd person and plays an animation when drinking a potion, like how there's an animation for Estus in Dark Souls.
- [Smart Optimal Salves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42402) is an add-on to ZUPA, so you don't have to go in your inventory to drink a potion!
- [zxlice BackStab and Parry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43436) is self-explanatory! Backstabs and attacks of opportunity after succesful blocks... A really neat add-on.
- [Heartbreaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1847) allows you to rip people's hearts straight from their chest. Metal, isn't it?
- [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252) and [True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) for the camera control, so it's actually usable in 3rd person.

### Gameplay - Combat | Enemies 

Enemies will be drastically changed; I have made a very thorough merge of many popular enemy overhauls, completely patched to work together. We are talking about mods like:
- [Skyrim Revamped - Complete Enemies Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14598) which buffs almost all enemies in the game.
- [Briraka's Draugr Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26188) and [Draugr Upgrades and Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21775) which makes named draugr more unique and brings varieties like fire draugr to the game.
- [OBIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145) the unavoidable bandits overhaul, with its Patrols addon.
- [Better Vampires NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9510#) with [Ubervamps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28919) which makes them an actual threat. I also added my own, unique, non available on nexus mod; **Sovn's Ebony Vampires - Porting Requiem Enemies to Vanilla Skyrim**.
- [Heritage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30017) which brings more enemy variants to almost all classes.
- [High Level Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3231) which, instead of the usual more variants, adds level 60+ enemies into leveled lists. 
- [Real Bosses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18183) because Skyrim Revamped does not touch bosses, for some reason, so this overhauls those to make sure the minions aren't stronger than the actual boss.
- [SkyTEST](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1104) for animals only so they are an actual threat passed level 5.
- [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) and its Variants add-on are what brings diversity and difficulty to Dragons so every encounter is a new challenge.
- My very own **Sovn's Enchanted Spheres - Porting Requiem Enemies to Vanilla Skyrim** to bring some actual bosses in Dwarven ruins.

Those are only the most prominent overhauls present. The above list isn't exhaustive.

"Wow Sovn, this is some madness! How am I supposed to survive?" Well listen here buddy, **the Encounter Zones are handmade**.

That's right, I heavily modified [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681)'s encounter zones. For the first couple levels early on, you will want to fight bandits. They should be as bad at combat as you. As you progress through doing [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) or normal quests due to [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751), you will get more enemies with more perks, and you will be able to do more and more stuff.

More on that in the next chapter of this guide.

## Gameplay - Leveling

Bandits are the best enemy in the beginning; they barely know how to fight (except their leaders) and aren't that organized. As you progress, you should be able to tackle stronger enemies such as draugr, forsworn, mages, dwarven constructions, dragons, and finally vampires and dragon priests.

Vampires are deceptively strong, do not fight them early, you will get murdered. Why? Because the game is **semi-leveled**; lemme explain:
- Normal enemies still scale with you, they start at lower levels and have a lot of variants between level 1 and 90.
- Bosses are higher level by default, between level 15 and 250 (that includes quest mods). There are a lot of static bosses that are straight up god-like, such as Master Vampires and Dragon Priests.
- All enemies get perks depending on their level. A level 1 enemy has 1 perk and a level 60 enemy has 60 perks.

**"But how do you get to the higher levels yourself? How do you even train your combat skills if everyone kills you"** - I am glad you asked! Let me introduce you to the 2 core mods for Player leveling:

- **[Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751)**
- **[Static Skill Leveling - Experience Mod Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30410)**

You will level up by discovering places, killing any enemy, and doing quests. Your stats do not influence your leveling at all, that is [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) Here is what the add-on changes:**Whenever you sleep, you will be able to allocate skill points in the skills you wish to improve on!**. Only the first time you sleep, after you've leveled up and added your Stamina/Health/Magic bonus, that is why [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667) is in ([it also uses a bonfire, neat isn't it?](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41223)).

But that isn't all there is to help you on your quest to becoming a god among men. Let's talk about the main overhauls.


## Gameplay - Main Overhauls | Perks, Races, Standing Stones, Magic, Religion and Alchemy

So I mostly play with **EnaiRim**, especially the full overhauls, and that isn't going to change *too much*. Lemme show you:

- **[Ordinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137)** for main perks.
- **[Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245)** for werewolf perks.
- **[Sacrosanct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928)** for vampire perks.

They have been choosen because they enable many different playstyles and also make you very powerful. Remember, we're not trying to nerf the player, just buff the enemies.

- **[Palladium Racials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43890)**

One of the deviations from main EnaiRim. Why? Because it allows both NPCs and the Player to use its passive effects, and it has parts of Imperious along with parts of other race overhauls. It will also bring a good diversity of potential builds.

- **[Mundustar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41674)**

Standing Stones overhaul with some drawbacks. I really wanted something different from the usual Andromeda, so I gave Mundustar a chance, and so far it has yet to disappoint me.

- **[Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000)** for vanilla spells.
- **[Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488)** for added spells.
- **[Forgotten Magic Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12711)** for reward spells. (more info below)
- **[Forceful Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276)** for shouts.
- **[Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612)** for artifact enchantments.

I really wanted a certain spell that loots bodies around you from Odin, so it's how this one got chosen over Mysticism. Many have suggested Arcanum in my old list, so I'm giving it a chance here. Trust me, there's more than enough spells for any type of mage with this setup, so no need for Apocalypse or similar large package mods! Forgotten Magic Redone's tomes have been **handplaced throughout the world, quest mods included, so they're rewarded at completion of quests and key moments in the game**. Let's be honest, that mod's spells are absolutely OP, and they're supposed to be lost, so why would a merchant sell them in the Bannered Mare? **This is why the readme tells you to deactivate the drops in the MCM Configuration**. Mothing stops you from enabling them, but would it be fun otherwise? You can also ask me hints about their location, and I'll try to help.

Forceful Tongue is used to overhaul Shouts as I've never really gotten into Thunderchild, so I wanted something I'd actually use. In the total opposite mindset, Reliquary of Myth is used because it simply is so much more fun than Zim's in my opinion.

- **[Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099)**

Simon's latest overhaul, I really wanted to test it since Wintersun was always just "here" in my eyes.

- **[Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130)**

I have sworn to never use kryptopyr's CACO ever again. This overhaul does *exactly* what it needs to do and is actually not a pain to patch. This is why it has been chosen. 
We use both the Main mod and it's Food addon!



You have all the tools to conquer the world thanks to the absurd strength and overpowered items, but those tools are also available to your enemies which will be forever challenging.

Now that the bulk of the gameplay has been covered, I will continue on the atmosphere of the list.

## Visuals - Atmosphere
### The 2 Options - Explications

The list uses [NLA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43166) as the weather mod. This choice shows a want of a bright, cold, atmospheric feeling, more on the realistic side of ENBs.

It was chosen over the usual Cathedral Weathers or Obsidian Weathers because I did not want something geared toward fantasy, but that doesn't mean there isn't another option.

I also tested a more dark fantasy feel with [Apex Somber](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41598) which gave an unique look.

Before downloading anything, keep in mind all the ENBs have been manually tweaked by me to give an even better feeling than their base options. They are located under ``Installation Folder\ENBs``. Simply drag and drop the files to your Skyrim SE Folder, although I would suggest you read the following parts to get more information on which to choose.

ENBs being the most impactful part of the list, textures were chosen to have a more realistic approach of Skyrim, especially weapons and armors (that got total overhauls instead of simple texture upscales). I tried to have the best texture, nifs, alpha etc.. for the item in question; almost everything that is smaller than your hand will be 1K, swords and armors are 2K, and architecture and elements larger than you are 4K. What makes the list heavy is mostly the added items in the worldpsace, not the choice of textures; it is also the high LODs used.

Because yes using 4K textures when playing at 1080p, when the mesh is wide, allows the rendered object to not appear blurry. Dragons and mountains are the first examples that come to mind. 

### Visuals - fnenb / Pacific Blue 

Those 2 ENBS are on the bright side.
- **[fnenb](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43998)** is more of a screenarchery ENB, it isn't good at every single moment, but it is so infrequent that I love it. It's lights are less blinding than the second enb but it is [brighter](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/761564792766726194/868966326566273095/unknown.png). It is made by Foxnne.
- **[Pacific Blue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44542)** is more clear than bright. That's where the difference is, but its lights are blinding a bit more, like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/761564792766726194/869238390468521984/unknown.png) and it uses a filmic lens, like a real camera. It is made by FOSSTEN

Both of those enbs have a realistic vibe which is what the list aims at.

### Visuals - Apex Somber 

**[Apex Somber ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41598)** by Digital Dreams has been a long time favourite of mine, for longer than the 2 above.
It changes the world into a [more grayscale shade](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/761564792766726194/869559862479183922/unknown.png) while still being [bright](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/761564792766726194/869564077586931772/unknown.png). It really has a unique vibe and its interiors are [insanely dark](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/761564792766726194/869560649892642846/unknown.png). In a dungeon, it really makes you think twice on where to go.

### Visuals - Other Enbs?

Those are the recommended ENBs, and the only ones I know that fit the Weather/Lighting mod used in Aldrnari. You are free to try anything else on Nexus, but keep in mind the screenshots from the modpage won't match what you have in game because we use **[NLA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43166)** and **[Lux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43158)** if the mod specifically stipulates that it is for another Weather/Lighting combo.

### Visuals - City Overhauls

- Base is [JK's Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71018) for most cities. On top of that, we use [Civil War Checkpoints](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17364) so the world looks really at war.
- Riverwood has [Galaxy's Riverwood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46360) and [Riverwood Flowering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39229), it gives it a unique and cheerful look.
- [Cities of the North: Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952), [Cities of the North: Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34168) and [Cities of the North: Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088) give those cities a really unique and Nordic atmosphere.
- Whiterun is now real fortified place thanks to [Fortified Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40094). It also has a lot of hand-placed trees so its connection to Kyne is felt throughout the city.
- Solitude now feels like a capital city with [The Great City of Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22243), [Drengin's Blue Palace Terrace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35180) and [Solitude Skyway](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8250) fully patched together!
- Windhelm also feels like a capital, with [Capital Windhelm Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42990) and [City Entrances Overhaul: Windhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19400)
- Riften is now a real influencial fishing port thanks to [Riften Docks Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40021) and gains some verticality thanks to [Another Skyrim: Riften](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86586).
- Markarth's wall is now massive thanks to [City Entrances Overhaul: Markarth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37375)
- "The Great City" Series overhauls a good number of minor towns and cities; we're talking [Falkreath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19709), [Rorikstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20151), [Mixwater Mill](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36350), [Karthwasten](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33032), [Kynesgrove](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42639), [Old Hroldan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33189), [Ivarstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34505) and [Shor's Stone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35977).
- Dragon Bridge is overhauled by [Rodryk](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42510)
- [Settlements Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7777) make sure even miners around small mines have houses.
- Raven Rock isn't forgotten, we use [Quaint Raven Rock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20851)
- The College of Winterhold is now a hub of magic thanks to [Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514).
- [Sepolcri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34105) makes sure the cemeteries in Solitude, Riften, and Falkreath aren't lame.
- [Viking Towns of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17132) and [Lyngwi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13526) are two mods adding Nordic-looking cities on top of everything that is above! 

### Visuals - Armors and Weapons

I love high quality armors and weapons. We are talking assets from Team TAL, Christine, FunkyGandalfCat, JS, DX, and other renowned artist. This is why I am going on a journey to hand-place as many items as possible throughout the world in a lore friendly way.

As an example, I have distributed into Leveled Lists, thanks to [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681), weapons from [Skyrim Weapons Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32500) or [Team TAL's Mordhau Weapons Pack](https://www.patreon.com/posts/mordhau-weapon-1-28144583) or armors from [Team TAL's Mordhau Armors Pack](https://www.patreon.com/posts/alpha-mordhau-by-27867837). While some NPCs have unique armors, in a Dark Souls way.

Hand-placed items are not restricted to armors and weapons, you will find spell tomes and other cosmetic items at the end of dungeons. Lastly some armors' recipes have been gated behind quests! For example, if you want Serana's Vampire armor, you must complete some Dawnguard Quests before being able to create it for yourself.

You can also notice that not lorefriendly armors have been added to the list, like [Spindrift Knight](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53728) or [Grandmaster Wolven](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51572), those are still in the game! You will have access to them by taking 2 perks in the smithing tree: 
- Hallowed Seamstress and Stoneweaver
  - For jewelry and dresses (Lore-Friendly)
- Senua's Wisdom
  - For items that are not Lore Friendly and/or Skimpy

This is made so you are not cluttered with 2000 free gear at level 1.

## Gameplay - Quests
### Gameplay - Main Questline, Daedric Quests, Miscellaneous Quests and DLCs

- [Skyrim Unbound](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962) is the alternate start choice of Aldrnari. The main quest has been altered slightly due to this mod. You do not have to go and gather the Dragonstone for Farengar. After a few weeks, Dragons will start spawning in the world and slaying your first Dragon will progress the main quest as normal. **YOU MUST SELECT THE DRAGONBORN OPTIONS, THE LIST RELIES ON BEING A DRAGONBORN, IT WILL BREAK IF NOT SELECTED**
- [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464) modifies the level and quest requirements to begin the DLCs, Daedric questlines, and some miscellaneous quests. These are the new triggers to begin the respective quests:
  - Hearthfire: 15
  - Dawnguard: 20 | But you can go early without problem by going straight to the Fort, getting Dexion will be extremely harder especially Dawnguard Side
  - Dragonborn: 25 + After Horn of Yurgen Windcaller
  - The Cursed Tribe: 25
  - The Break of Dawn: 45 + Must not be a vampire
  - The Only Cure: 40

  - Kill the Giant: 22 - Dawnstar Thane
  - Dungeon Delving: 20
  - Deathbrand: 36
  - Ebony Warrior: 65

### Gameplay - Modified and Expanded Quests

- The Companions are heavily modified by [Don't be a milk drinker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19490), [questline tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22300) and [More Radiant quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24144)
- [Jiub's Opus gets quest markers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17056)
- [Goldenglow is Yours](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25155) after you rob it but you will have [Requirements to enter the Thieves Guild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256)
- We avoid Arthmoor's terrible Paarthurnax mod by instead using the fantastic [The Paarthurnax Resolution](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43766)
- You can [save the Icerunner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34681)
- On top of [Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514), that questline has also an [Improved admission test](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22184), [enemies in Labyrinthian incentivize mage gameplay](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44557) and there is [more tweaks from Obscure](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22653).
- [You can avoid the entirety of the Forsworn conspiracy.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43850)

### Gameplay - New Quests
Gotta have quest mods if there is no Legacy of the Dragonborn, right? 

- **[VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849)** brings a Vigilant of Stendarr questline, featuring the never ending struggle against Molag Bal. Vicn's first quest mod. Heavily inspired by Dark Souls in its atmosphere, styles, combats, enemies, armors, and stories. Has the most tweaks of all the quest mods for the ultimate experience. Separated in 4 Acts. It is also my favourite quest mod.
- **[UNSLAAD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789)** is a Half Dragon quest mod. The second work of Vicn. Very similar to VIGILANT but with a way colder and sad atmosphere rather than dark and grim. Can also be quite wholesome per moments. Heavily inspired by Dark Souls. It is also my second favourite quest mod.
- **[Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194)** Personal stories of many, _many_ NPCs hidden throughout the world. Many are followers and others are just quests. NPCs with more extensive dialogue and role-play choices. Over 250+ fully voiced NPCs, 25+ followers, 15+ marriage NPCs, and 50+ quests.
- **[The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179)** is the first mod in history to win a national Writers' Guild award for its script. It is a critically acclaimed expansion mod offering a unique 6 - 8 hour experience: a murder mystery investigation set in an ancient underground city. You'll need to solve it using your wits, and the ability to travel through time...

## Gameplay - New NPC Encounters and Followers

- **[Extended Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44810)** and [Immersive World Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18330) will bring enough diversity to the game so something is always happening in Skyrim.

- **[Citizens of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29069)** places unique NPCs with varied stories but everything is questless. Have a chat in a tavern or while adventuring, take five minutes to listen to some nifty backstories and world building.

### Inigo...?
A majority of people like him. I personally don't. On top of that, users reported non-issues from other Wabbajack lists to his Nexus page which led them to make a public pinned post about their [non-favorable stance with what we do](http://prntscr.com/1b2tt18). He needs tweaks, he is too strong and unbalanced, all followers above have been tweaked, since I am not allowed to do so by the Mod Author, I will not include him. This decision is final.
